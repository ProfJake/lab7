# practiceDB dump file (mongodb)

# A simple dummy db for students to practice with
# The starting point for the lab.  IF you were not in class or were otherwise
unable to follow along with the lecture activity, make sure you go back and
watch that video/get the notes from a fellow student, and do the exerciss that
we do in the video, otherwise you will get "incorrect" results.  You'll be
turning in screenshots of your queries and transactions as well as their
results.
